update your custom ebuilds automatically! stay on the bleeding edge!

so i've noticed that release/latest on git gives you the latest source, which can be used to infer new version and bump ebuild.
this idea can be used to simplify ebuilds maintenane. no need to check up on new versions, just run a script and it'll grab the changes.

probably something similar could be used to simply maintenance in portage.
